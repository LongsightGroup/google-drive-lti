    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>GDrive provides an easy way to share Google Drive folders, subfolders, documents, drawings and 
    other Google items with all members of a CTools site. 
    GDrive automatically accesses the roster of students or participant 
    list in your site.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="c1">Please note:</span> 
    <ul>
        <li>Only instructors and project
        owners can share one of their folders. 
        <li>For each site, only one
        folder from Google Drive can be shared, but that folder can
        contain an unlimited number of sub folders.
        <li>At this time, GDrive will not work in classes with more than 200 students.
    </ul></p>
    <p>Terms used in this help document:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Google Drive"</strong> refers to your Google
            Drive.</li>
        <li><strong>"GDrive"</strong> is the Google Drive tool that
            you can add to a site such as an LMS site.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Supported Browsers</h2>
    <p>Most modern browsers are supported, except:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IE 8 and earlier are not supported.</li>
        <li>Firefox is partially supported -- scrolling back to
            display prompts doesn't work in some cases.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Sharing a Google Drive folder with your site's GDrive</h2>
    <p>When you share a folder that exists on your Google Drive with
        GDrive, the folder will become the top-level folder in GDrive.
        You only need to do this one time for each site. You can add
        subfolders to this folder.</p>
    <p>To share a Google Drive folder with GDrive on your site:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>While you are in your site, click <strong>GDrive</strong>
            in the left-hand menubar.
            <p>All the folders on your Google Drive will
                automatically appear in the site's GDrive window. (It
                may take a little while for them to load.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Share Folder</strong> button to the
            right of the folder you would like to link to and use as the
            top-level folder.
        </li>
        <li>An email preference box will open asking if you would
            like to send email notifications to all members of your
            site.
            <div class="screenshots">
                <img alt="" src="images/image01.png" class="c2" title="">
            </div>
            <p>Once you have completed these steps, you will see the
                shared folder in both the GDrive window and on your
                Google Drive.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Viewing a folder or subfolder from your site on
                your Google Drive</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>While in GDrive, click the folder's name in the
                    list.</li>
                <li>In the window that opens, click <strong>Open
                        in Drive</strong> in the upper right-hand corner.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Changing the top-level folder</h2>
            <p>You can create a new top-level folder in your site's
                GDrive or share a different folder from your Google
                Drive. You will first need to unshare the original
                folder.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>While in your site, click <strong>Unshare</strong>
                    to the right of the folder you no longer want to use
                    as the top-level folder.
                </li>
                <li>To link to a folder in your Google Drive, click
                    <strong>Share Folder</strong> to the right of the
                    folder you want to link to and use as the top
                    folder. Type a name, and choose your email
                    preference.
                </li>
                <li>To create a new folder, click the <strong>Create
                        &amp; Share Folder</strong> button.
                    <p>(You may need to refresh your screen for the
                        button to appear.)</p>
                    <p>Type a name for the new folder in the small
                        window that opens. Then choose your email
                        preference.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            </div>
            <p>You will see the folder in both the GDrive window and
                on your Google Drive.</p>
            <p>Folders and items in folders are listed
                alphabetically.</p>

            <h2>Adding a subfolder</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In the <strong>Add</strong> dropdown menu to
                    the right of the folder to which you would like to
                    add a subfolder, select <strong>Add Folder</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>Name the folder.</li>
                <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.

            <h2>Deleting folders and other items</h2>

                <li>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button to the

                <span class="c1">Note:</span> This cannot be undone. It will also delete the
                item in Google Drive. Deleting a folder will also delete
                its contents. (The top-level folder cannot be deleted --
                only unshared.)</p>
            <p>In GDrive, users with "Can Edit" permissions can
                delete a document they do not own. In Google Drive, they
                can remove the document to move it to Trash.</p>

            <h2>Common questions about sharing and permissions in
                GDrive</h2>
            <p class="question">If I unshare a folder in GDrive,
                does that remove site member permissions for the folder
                on Google Drive?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes. All site members (with the
                exception of the owner of the folder) will have their
                permissions removed.</p>
            <p class="question">If I remove a user from my site
                roster, will his or her permissions be removed from any
                shared folders?</p>
            <p class="answer">No. You must remove individual users
                you wish to no longer have access to shared Google
                folders (or choose to unshare it with the whole site).</p>
            <p class="question">If I delete a shared folder, will
                users still have access?</p>
            <p class="answer">When you delete a Google folder, it
                first goes to the Trash where it can still be restored.
                When you empty the trash, the folder is permanently
                deleted.</p>
            <p class="answer">Users cannot access folders in the
                Trash or those that have been permanently deleted.
                However, if a folder in the Trash is restored, user
                permissions will also be restored.</p>
            <p class="question">If I share a folder between two
                sites (A &amp; B) and unshare a folder on Site B, will I
                retain access to the folder on Site A?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes, you can still access the folder
                on Site A. However, to continue to have access to the
                folder on Google Drive, you must first go to Site A and
                open the folder from there. You only need to do this
                once. After that, you will always be able open the
                folder while in Google Drive."</p>
            <p class="question">What folders can I share?</p>
            <p class="answer">You can share folders that have either
                "Can Edit" or "Owner" permissions.</p>
            <p class="question">Who can delete a document on a site?</p>
            <p class="answer">In GDrive, users with "Can Edit"
                permissions can delete a document they do not own. In
                Google Drive, they can remove the document to move it to
                Trash. An example of this workflow is multiple
                instructors on a site can edit and remove documents.</p>

             <ul>
                 
             <li>Search results only match against the start of words. 
                For example, if there is  a folder named "my testfest" and "fest" is the search term, 
                the folder will not be returned. If "test" is used, it will. </p>
                
                
                
            <b>Workaround:</b>  To see the folder contents that do not match the search text, 
            the search field needs to be cleared.</p><br>
                 
   
             <li>Expanding search results does not display subfolders unless the subfolders
